We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comments and questions about our work, that we have carefully considered and incorporated in the revised version of our paper. In the following, we comment upon each point raised by the reviewer, and refer to the appropriate place in the text where major changes have occurred. (As the numbering of the equations has changed slightly in the revision, in our answers we refer to the new numbering.) We are confident the new version wil satsify the Referee, but will be glad to make further improvements should teh discusssions need to be clarified further.

We have indeed checked the behavior of the Mq term in a model with a pseudoscalar Yukawa interaction modeling the uark fragmentation process. This clearly show that Mq>mq. We added a comment to this effect at the end of Section II together with a revised discussion of the estimate of the magnitude of Mq, see next.

The Referee is right in noticing that nothing a pripori prevents Mq to become smaller than ~100 MeV. Our estimate was based on the fact that one can expect the two-particle continuum to open up at (mq+m_pi)~m_pi~Lambda_QCD, and therefore the value of mu averaged over the J2 distribution should be around our originally quoted value. We have revised this estimate taking also into acocunt that a quark is in fact not a physical asymptotic state, and Mq could be smaller than that, and now quotw Mq~10-100 MeV.

Note that, having exactly Mq=mq would imply the existence of a so far unknown symmetry or otherwise general constraint that would be extremely interesting on its own. Although we judge this unlikely, our paper may, if nothing else, encourage people to prove us wrong and discover a new feature of QCD.

The modified discussion, incorporating alsocomment #1, can be found at the end of Section II.

We agree with the referee, and in fact our original discussion was somewhat confusing. We have enlarged teh scope of the discussion and reviewed some perturbative and resummed results on the small x behavior of h1. The small-x physics of the h1 function in comparison to g1 is indeed an interesting topic of research, that can now also be accessed experimentally thanks to our extended WW and BC relations.

The modified discussion can be found in teh paragraph above Eq.()

We thank the referee also for this level of attention to our work, that has indeed helped us to improve the article.
